# MLM-IDEX
MLM IDEX is a mod for BLV MGN CUBE Project



BLV MLM IDEX is a project started in August 2020 in collaboration with Loris Granatella and Mario Salerno. 
We redesigned Ben Levi's BLV MGN Cube and created an IDEX version. 
This printer allows you to create copy, mirror and IDEX configuration prints (using two different colours or materials).
The MLM IDEX is equipped with MASP Hotend MK8-R All Metal with adjustable titanium throat, Duet 2 Wi-Fi, Duex5.
The X and U axes are driven by powerful LDO Motors 0.9° 1.4A pancakes that allow 800/step rotations. 
The same ones are also used for E0 and E1, combined with a specially designed dual drive system.  
The Y-axis is driven by two Wantai 0.9° 2.4A motors working in pairs: the advantage is the possibility to move the x/u bridge at high speeds and without uncertainties, also thanks to the use of a robust 9mm reinforced GT2 belt (Gates Powergrip).
Regarding the X- and U-axes, 6mm GT2 (Gates Powergrip) belts were used to reduce space requirements and to have less moving mass than the Y-axis.
A cleaning system tied to the X/U bridge ensures that the inactive tool nozzle can purge outside the plate (tool parking area) and cleans the nozzle before it enters the printing area.
The calibration of the Z offset, for "Tool 0" (i.e. X), is semi-automatic thanks to the use of a contact probe (BLTouch) and a procedure written by us ad hoc to facilitate the operation. As for the "Tool 1" (i.e. U) the calibration of the Z offset is manual, effectively facilitated by the constructive conformation of the MASP MK8-R hotend.
It is possible to choose between two or three trapezoid screws, driven by powerful Wantai 1.8° 2.5A motors.
The plate heater is a 600W - 220V "membrane" type, the top is made of 6mm ground aluminium.
The project is open source, all the necessary parts are freely available for purchase and printing.
The project provides all the files for the configuration that we have developed after months of testing.
